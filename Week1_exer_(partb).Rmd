###"Week 1 Exercise (part b)
##Aquainting myself with knitR PDF/HTML Rmarkdown documents

#Drawing values from the log-normal distribution (generate data for mu = 1, sigma = 0.25)
```{r}
x = rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 0, sdlog = .25)

```

## Including Plots: Histogram (histogram visualisation of the sample values)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#histogram
hist(x,
     main = "Exercise Wk1 (partb)",
     xlab = "x",
     ylab = "Frequency"
     )

#log-transformed histogram
hist(log(x))
```
## What's Mean and Variance of this sample?
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
mean <- mean(x)
variance <- var(x)

mean
variance
```
